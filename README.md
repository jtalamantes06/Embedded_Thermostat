# Embedded_Thermostat

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**

&emsp;The project was to design a prototype of a thermostat that is capable to be able to send data of the current temperature, temperature goal, if the heater is on, and the amount of elapsed time. This data is used to help understand the process it takes to reach the user's temperature goal. It helps understand if it reaches its goal, how long it took, and if the heater was used.



**What did you do particularly well?**

&emsp;What I did particularly well was being able to keep the coding organized and clean with comments to understand the coding. If I had someone look over to help, they could easily see what I did particularly and able to make the right changes, if needed.


**Where could you improve?**

&emsp;I feel I could have improved my method of my coding. It could of been used with less coding and give faster results. Another thing I could improve is the security of the coding. As it was not part of the project, I feel I could of still sticked with the best secure practices to keep my coding secure.


**What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?**

&emsp;The tools I will be adding to my support network will be the launchpad. This tool will be useful on being able to create and work on future projects that will help me improve my coding skills.


**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?**

&emsp;The skills I learned from this project will help me move out to bigger and different projects. It will help me understand how much more I can expand my knowledge to many different ideas. 


**How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

&emsp;I was able to ensure that the project was clean and easy to read. I also left comments to allow others to be able to understand the reason for my coding in the sections. By doing so, if I have someone looking over the coding and wanted to make changes they can easily know what they need to change to improve the coding.
